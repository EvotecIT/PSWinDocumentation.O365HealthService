<tr><td>MC177199</td><td>05.04.2019 05:14:00</td><td>Changes to Coming Soon in Outlook for Windows</td><td>As announced in MC147799 in September 2018, we introduced a new “Coming Soon” feature that offers a preview of new user experience updates in Outlook for Windows and provides you and your users an opportunity to try the experience and to provide feedback. This month, we’re rolling out a new density setting to control the amount of space between emails in the message list, as well as spacing around some of the elements visible when composing a message. This setting will show up for customers who have Coming Soon turned on.<BR>
All of the experience updates that are now behind Coming Soon will be rolling out as the default experience to all Monthly Channel customers in May 2019. These feature updates are not yet available for GCC organizations.<BR>
This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap IDs: <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;featureid=26542'>26542</a> and <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;featureid=46976'>46976</a>.<BR>
[How does this affect me?]
Since we introduced Coming Soon, we gained a lot of valuable feedback about the user experience updates. The majority of feedback on these improvements is positive, but we’ve also heard from some users that they prefer tighter spacing in emails over the looser spacing that was designed to make the message list easier to scan visually.<BR>
Now when you toggle Coming Soon to “On” you’ll have access to the <a href='https://support.office.com/article/density-settings-7aedcfaf-03de-49ad-9bf8-8730134f1f3b'>new density setting</a> option that’s located in the View tab in your Outlook ribbon. Similar to switching between the simplified and classic Ribbon, you can switch between standard and tighter spacing from the View tab in the ribbon. We appreciate your engagement with Coming Soon features and your feedback, and we hope to continue receiving your suggestions on features in preview.<BR>
In May, the other user experience updates previously introduced in the Coming Soon pane will become the default experience and the on/off toggle and the Coming Soon pane will no longer be available. The Coming Soon preview pane and toggle may re-appear when we are ready to roll out additional capabilities in preview. To review the features that are now part of Outlook for Windows, please reference the Outlook blog post that covers them <a href='https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Outlook-Blog/Designed-for-Simplicity-User-experience-updates-to-Outlook-for/ba-p/241590'>here</a>.<BR>
[What do I need to do to prepare for this change?]
There’s nothing that you need to do to prepare for this change, but we suggest that your users explore the Coming Soon pane and learn about the density setting option, as this feature will soon be on-by-default.<BR>

<tr><td>MC177122</td><td>04.04.2019 03:42:00</td><td>Reminder: SharePoint tenant opt-out for modern lists is retiring in 2019</td><td>As previously communicated in MC172925 in February 2019, we're making some changes to how environments can opt out of modern lists in SharePoint.<BR>
Starting April 24, 2019, it will no longer be possible to restrict an entire organization (tenant) to classic mode for lists and libraries.<BR>
[How does this impact me?]
In 2016, we introduced a new “modern” experience for SharePoint, bringing extensibility, accessibility, and responsive design to a complete overhaul of the user experience. Since then, modern has been the center of innovation in SharePoint and OneDrive, although classic mode remains supported and available. We’re making it easier for users to get to our latest feature updates.  Users will benefit from enhancements and new features such as attention views, PowerApps integration, Flow, column formatting, and the filters pane.<BR>
Starting April 24th, 2019, it will no longer be possible to restrict an entire organization (tenant) to classic mode for lists and libraries. The setting that previously allowed this opt-out will no longer appear in the UI, and tenants that were previously using the setting to opt out of modern will be switched to using the modern experience by default.  This change will roll out between April 24th and May 31st. After the change affects your environment, lists and libraries that are in classic mode as a result of tenant opt-out will automatically be shifted to modern.<BR>
There are no plans to remove classic mode and we’ll maintain the current feature set for classic lists and library experiences. Lists and libraries may still use classic mode using the granular opt-out switches that we provide at the site collection, site, list, and library levels.  Additionally, lists that use certain features and customizations that are not supported by modern will still be automatically switched to classic mode.<BR>
Please note that we cannot predict exactly what day this change will affect your environment during this rollout.  However, you are welcome to control this change yourself by configuring your tenant to use modern lists before the change makes that mandatory.<BR>
[What should I do to prepare for this change?]
The SharePoint Modernization scanner identifies sites and lists that have customizations that are not supported by modern UI.  Although many of these lists will automatically remain in classic mode even after this change, you may wish to keep some sites running entirely in classic to avoid users switching between different experience modes within a single site.<BR>
Administrators can use a PowerShell script to enable or disable the modern experience for a single site collection or for a list of site collections as provided by the SharePoint Modernization scanner.  Alternately, users can still use the “return to classic” option on modern views of lists or libraries to temporary return to classic, list owners can use List Settings to configure that list to use the classic experience for all users, and site collection owners can use Site Collection</td><td>04.04.2019 03:42:00</td><td>Normal</td><td>04.04.2019 03:42:00</td><td>31.05.2019 09:00:00</td><td>Action</td><td>Advisory</td><td>SharePoint Online</td><td>MessageCenter</td></tr>

For enrolled devices, you’ll be able to manage the general app configuration settings for Outlook mobile that have an on/off option such as saving contacts, blocking external images, requiring biometric-based access (iOS only), Focused Inbox and External Recipient MailTips.<BR>
These settings can now be managed through an App Configuration Policy in Intune or via your existing MDM solution.<BR>
Whether deploying a new set of users or simplifying how existing users are supported, you will be able to manage the app configuration settings in Outlook mobile using Microsoft Intune or your existing MDM solution. Security related settings with on/off options can be managed by administrators and configured to prevent users from changing them. Other settings such as Focused Inbox will continue to be adjustable by users. Configuring these options can deliver a consistent experience for Outlook mobile on your managed devices and help keep your company data safe. This can also help reduce the calls to your helpdesk and simplify the support process for those users.<BR>
We are launching these capabilities today (Outlook for iOS is already in the Appstore) and we anticipate rollout for Outlook for Android to be fully completed by March 28, 2019.<BR>

This rollout is excluded from Microsoft 365 subscriptions in GCC at this time.<BR>
This will roll out to Targeted Release starting at the end of March and is expected to complete worldwide by the end of April.<BR>
[How does this impact me?]
With this update, users will be able to find many of their first-degree LinkedIn connections as people suggestions when sharing files or folders from OneDrive, SharePoint, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint Online. This makes it easier for employees in your organization to collaborate with people outside your organization without needing to know their email addresses.<BR>
This update respects all the existing external sharing policies and settings that you have configured in your organization. For example, this update will not suddenly enable external sharing with LinkedIn contacts for files which are not allowed to be shared externally. The OneDrive common sharing experience also implements safeguards to limit accidental external sharing by informing users when they have selected someone outside their organization.<BR>
[What should I do to prepare for this change?]
Both administrators and end users have control over this experience. Information for administrators is here: <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/linkedin-integration'>LinkedIn integration</a>, including how to disable. End users with enabled accounts must opt-in by securely connecting their LinkedIn and Microsoft accounts before they can use this feature. <a href='https://support.office.com/article/connect-your-linkedin-and-microsoft-accounts-dc81cc70-4d64-4755-9f1c-b9536e34d381'>Connect your LinkedIn and Microsoft accounts</a> has information for end users about how to connect, what is shared, what’s not shared, and an FAQ.<BR>
Please review your existing sharing policies to verify your experience with this new feature.<BR>
Data is shared between the accounts to enable enhanced experiences in both Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn. We respect their privacy and honor settings across both services.

GCC High and Department of Defense organizations did not receive the original announcement. Based on your feedback, we’re providing more clarity, additional flexibility to the roll out plans and expanding the audience.<BR>
This enhancement is related to Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;featureid=32955'>32955</a> and <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;featureid=32956'>32956</a><BR>
The roll out of Teams in Outlook mobile will take into consideration your organization’s plans to upgrade to Teams. The experience in Outlook mobile will be based on how you have set your coexistence mode between Teams and Skype for Business in the Microsoft Teams admin center or in PowerShell (Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy), at the tenant level and/or for the user.<BR>
We will start to roll out these changes at the beginning of April 2019 and will support Office 365 Monthly Channel customers world-wide as well as US Government Community Cloud (GCC) customers including GCC High and Department of Defense.<BR>
[How does this impact me?]
The experience for Teams Meetings in Outlook mobile will be based on how you set the organization’s or individual users’ Teams and Skype coexistence mode based on the following:<BR>
<table border="2" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b> Coexistence mode in Teams Admin Center </b></td>
<td><b> Meetings solution in Outlook mobile  </b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Teams Only</td>
<td> Teams</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Skype for Business with Teams Collaboration and Meetings* </td>
<td> Teams </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Skype for Business with Teams Collaboration*</td>
<td> Skype for Business</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Skype for Business Only </td>
<td> Skype for Business</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Islands</td>
<td> Skype for Business</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The experience in Outlook mobile will be based on this coexistence mode setting at the tenant and the user level. The user level setting, if present, will take precedence over the tenant level setting. For example, regardless of the tenant level setting, if a user’s coexistence mode is “Teams Only” or “Skype for Business with Teams Collaboration and Meetings”, then they will be able to add Teams meetings instead of Skype for Business when creating Outlook mobile events.<BR>
Similarly, if a user’s coexistence mode is “Skype for Business Only”, “Skype for Business with Teams collaboration”, or “Islands”, then nothing changes. They will continue to have the option to add Skype for Business meetings in Outlook mobile.<BR>
In addition, for customers who have also started to use the Microsoft sync technology for Outlook mobile (MC165218), we’re introducing a new Teams Join button in calendar events. This makes it easy to Join a Teams meeting and will be available for all coexistence modes as users could be invited to Teams Meetings even if they are not enabled to create Teams meetings themselves. Customers who are not using the Outlook mobile sync technology yet will continue to be able to join Teams Meetings using the weblink in the meeting description.<BR>
Note that the addition of the Teams Join button does not replace the Skype Join button. The Skype Join button will continue to be offered for Skype Meetings, and the Teams Join button will be offered for Teams Meetings.<BR>
[What should I do to prepare for this change?]
There is nothing you need to do to prepare for this change however you may want to check your organization’s settings for Teams coexistence by April 1st, 2019 to be sure it is set to fit your organizational needs when we roll out these changes or if you wish to set preferences for certain groups of users within your organization.<BR>

A new version of the Microsoft 365 Admin mobile app will be released with the following updates:

<li>Ability to restore corporate devices to factory state</li>
<li>Ability to remove corporate data from personal devices</li><BR>
[What should I do to prepare for this change?]
You do not need to do anything to prepare for this change. There is no requirement to use the mobile app.<BR>
The mobile app will be available in the iTunes App Store and Google Play store in late first quarter of calendar year 2019.<BR>

[How does this affect me?]<BR>
Currently, when a temporary routing error occurs, we repeatedly attempt to send the message for 48 hours before the system returns a bounce message (or non-delivery report (NDR)) to the sender.<BR>
This change reduces the Office 365 message expiration timeout interval from 48 hours to 24 hours. By reducing the message expiration timeout interval to 24 hours, senders will know sooner if we were unable to deliver their message, and can respond to the error in a more timely fashion.<BR>
Note that this will only affect messages queued on Office 365 servers. The message expiration times for messages queued on servers outside of Office 365 are not affected by this change.<BR>

The ability to create Teams meetings will be available to all Outlook mobile customers. For customers who have migrated to the updated architecture using the Microsoft sync technology, as communicated in message center post MC165218, we’re also making it easier and faster to join a Teams meeting by introducing a new Join button in calendar events.<BR>
This does not impact Office 365 subscriptions within GCC.<BR>
[How does this impact me?]
If your organization has enabled Teams only, then your users will start to see the option to add Teams when creating or editing calendar events in Outlook mobile. If your organization is enabled for both Skype for Business and Teams, the option to create Teams meetings will replace the option to create Skype meetings for your users in Outlook mobile. If some of the people in your organization still need to create Skype meetings, they can continue to do so from Outlook for Windows, Outlook for Mac and Outlook on the web.<BR>
Customers who are not using the Outlook mobile sync technology yet will continue to be able to join Teams meeting using the weblink in the meeting description.<BR>
If users in your organization receive invitations to Skype meetings, there is no change to the current experience, they will continue to see the Join button in those calendar events.<BR>
[What should I do to prepare for this change?]
There is nothing you need to do to prepare for this change if your organization has already enabled Teams for your users.<BR>

The navigation bar on OneDrive for Business, SharePoint Online, your OneDrive for Business admin center, and your SharePoint Online admin center will have one theme, shared features and capabilities. This should simplify how your users interact with the navigation bar and how your organizational brand appears.<BR>
Here are the changes that you’ll see in the navigation bar:<BR>
- If you’ve already set a theme for Office 365 in your Organizational Profile settings, this will be honored in this update.<BR>
Our previous communication regarding this feature was not clear in explaining the following aspects of the change, we hope that this clarification is useful.<BR>
- If your users have <a href='https://support.office.com/article/personalize-your-office-365-experience-eb34a21b-52fa-4fbf-a8d5-146132242985'>personalized Office 365</a> by selecting a theme for the navigation bar, this theme will now appear for them in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online. If you prefer that users don’t personalize the navigation bar, select the ”Prevent users from overriding theme” box in your <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/setup/customize-your-organization-theme?view=o365-worldwide'>Organizational Profile settings</a>.<BR>
- The Site theme selected for a specific SharePoint site through <a href='https://support.office.com/article/change-the-look-of-your-sharepoint-site-06bbadc3-6b04-4a60-9d14-894f6a170818'>Change the look settings</a> will no longer be applied to the navigation bar. The updated navigation bar will now be consistent as you navigate through a site, SharePoint Online and the Office 365 suite of apps (OneDrive for Business, Outlook.com, Office.com, etc.). The navigation bar theme will show the user-personalized theme, if one is selected. If there is no personalized theme, the navigation bar theme will follow either the Organizational Profile or the OneDrive for Business/SharePoint Online brand color (blue).<BR>
- The brand color for OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online is now blue, changed from the older black header and blue app launcher. For an image of the header with the new brand color, see “Updated Office 365 suite header experience for OneDrive and SharePoint” on “<a href='https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-SharePoint-Blog/SharePoint-Roadmap-Pitstop-January-2019/ba-p/328804'>Roadmap Pitstop: January 2019</a>.”<BR>
-  In SharePoint Online, the Gear icon now opens a pane to show the same settings options that you’re familiar with. There’s also a new section under settings that takes you to all Office 365 settings. This is where a user can personalize by selecting a theme.<BR>
- In OneDrive for Business, “Settings” and “Restore my OneDrive” are now the top selections in the settings pane.<BR>
- The help pane in both OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online also have a new look, which provides a richer experience. It provides the latest support information and support articles, and helps with common issues without having to leave OneDrive for Business or SharePoint Online. You'll find the same custom links that you've set up, but it's good to review that the links are working as they may get more attention in the new pane from your users.<BR>
We began rolling this out to Targeted Release organizations in mid-February, and the roll out will be completed worldwide by early March 2019.<BR>
[What do I need to do to prepare for this change?]
If you prefer not to have the navigation bar appear in the new OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online brand color, or you wish to allow your users to choose their own theme, update the settings for your Organizational Profile by clicking <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/setup/customize-your-organization-theme?view=o365-worldwide'> here </a>.<BR>
If your user has previously selected an Office 365 theme, this will now appear for them in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online. Any other preferences that your users have selected for the navigation bar, like disabling notifications, will be honored in this update.<BR>

In 2016, we introduced a new “modern” experience for SharePoint, bringing extensibility, accessibility, and responsive design to a complete overhaul of the user experience. Since then, modern has been the center of innovation in SharePoint and OneDrive, although classic mode remains supported and available.<BR>
We’re making it easier for users to get to our latest feature updates. Starting April 1, 2019, it will no longer be possible to restrict an entire organization (tenant) to classic mode for lists and libraries. Lists and libraries may still use classic mode using the granular opt-out switches that we provide at the site collection, site, list, and library levels. Additionally, lists that use certain features and customizations that are not supported by modern will still be automatically switched to classic mode.<BR>
After April 1, lists and libraries that are in classic mode as a result of tenant opt-out will automatically be shifted to modern. Users will benefit from enhancements and new features such as attention views, PowerApps integration, Flow, column formatting, and the filters pane.<BR>
[What should I do to prepare for this change?]
The SharePoint Modernization scanner identifies sites and lists that have customizations that are not supported by modern UI. Although many of these lists will automatically remain in classic mode even after this change, you may wish to keep some sites running entirely in classic to avoid users switching between different experience modes within a single site.<BR>
Administrators can use a PowerShell script to enable or disable the modern experience for a single site collection or for a list of site collections as provided by the SharePoint Modernization scanner. Alternately, users can still use the “return to classic” option on modern views of lists or libraries to temporary return to classic, and list owners can use List Settings to configure that list to use the classic experience for all users.<BR>

<tr><td>MC172851</td><td>01.02.2019 19:51:00</td><td>New feature: Changes to PowerPoint and Word to open files faster</td><td>We’re excited to release a new change to make documents saved to OneDrive and SharePoint open faster. We’ll be rolling this change out soon.<BR>
Rather than always checking for updates for cloud files prior to opening, Word and PowerPoint will open any existing version on the user’s device and then sync updates immediately afterwards. This is already the behavior today for files saved to local OneDrive and SharePoint sync folders. This change introduces this behavior for files that are stored on the cloud but not synced to your device in a sync folder.<BR>
This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID: <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;featureid=45426'>45426</a>.<BR>
[How does this affect me?]
After this change takes place, while Word or PowerPoint checks for the latest version of a non-synced file, users will see the previous version of a document stored in the Office Document Cache.<BR>
Users will be able to see the sync status of their files in the Status Bar (along the bottom of the window) and will be notified accordingly if we are unable to get the latest version. For example, for files that were deleted or moved on the server, the user will receive a message after opening the cached copy. If the user has AutoSave turned on for the file, they will automatically see the latest changes. Otherwise, they will see it the next time they Save or click on "Updates Available" in the Status Bar.<BR>
Users and automated scripts or add-ins should avoid acting (especially creating copies, printing, presenting) on files that are modified on multiple machines until the file is up to date.<BR>
This change updates the behavior for non-synced files to match the behavior of files stored within a user’s sync folders, which already open the version stored on their machine while changes are downloaded. This will apply to files opened directly from OneDrive, SharePoint (both Online as well as On-Premises) or Microsoft Teams that are not in a local sync folder.<BR>
By default, files are kept in the Office Document Cache for 14 days. Users can delete specific files from the Office Document Cache via the Upload Center. If files are deleted or if a user has chosen to automatically delete files from the Office Document Cache when they are closed, users will not be able to view files as quickly.<BR>
We will begin rolling these changes out to Monthly Channel organizations at the end of February, beginning with PowerPoint, and we anticipate rollout completion to all Monthly Channel organizations for both Word and PowerPoint to take place over the next few months. We anticipate that organizations using our Semi-Annual Channels will also receive the change as a part of the September 2019 Semi-Annual (Targeted) release.<BR>
[What do I need to do to prepare for this change?]
Performance is very important to us and the goal of this change is for users to have a faster experience when opening cloud documents. In most cases, we do not expect an impact to existing workflows. However, we are sensitive to potential unexpected impacts. While existing APIs remain unchanged, it’s possible that add-ins or automated processes that assume Word or PowerPoint files are up to date with the cloud immediately upon document open may need to be updated.<BR>

We are updating the “change the look” settings with additional options to enable customization of select site brand elements – specifically, header layouts, footer control, and navigation layout options. In addition to setting the theme and header background, site owners will now be able to switch between two site header layouts, each changing the position or displaying of header elements. The new megamenu navigation layout is only available for horizontally oriented navigation controls and allows for a panel display of links/labels up to three levels. The footer control is initially only available for modern pages in new and existing communication sites, a logo or title and up to 8 links or labels. Along with these updates, the content bar (also referred to as the “social bar”) - which contains the Like, Comment, View and Save for Later icons - will be docked permanently on top of the Comments section on all modern pages and news posts. We'll begin rolling this out to Targeted Release organizations in Feb 2019, and the worldwide roll out will be completed by the end of March 2019. This roll out was initially scheduled for November 2018 and was delayed until now.<BR>

After October 1, 2019 users that attempt to log in to StaffHub will be greeted with a message directing them to download Microsoft Teams.<BR>
To help you in your transition to Microsoft Teams, we ask that you review the details below for pre-requisites related to user and data migration across Microsoft Teams and StaffHub.<BR>
If you’re receiving this notice, you have one or more people in your organization who currently use Microsoft StaffHub. Please communicate these details to the right stakeholders in your organization.<BR>
[How does this affect me?]
To help transition users, we plan to migrate data chat history in Microsoft StaffHub to Microsoft Teams. The amount of chat history that will be available in Microsoft Teams will depend on how soon you configure your organization for the transition. We recommend taking action no later than June 30, 2019 to provide enough time to transition 90 days of data by October 1, 2019. Please ensure that Microsoft Teams and Office 365 Group Creation are enabled in your Microsoft 365 admin center before the transition begins, as these setting selections are essential to us being able to move your StaffHub data into Teams. Failure to turn these services on by June 30, 2019, will result in a later migration date or less chat data being copied over.<BR>
Please note, by enabling Microsoft Teams and Office 365 Group Creation, we will create a corresponding Microsoft Teams team and Office 365 Group if those do not already exist for each of your StaffHub teams as part of the migration effort. We will also begin copying Microsoft StaffHub chat messages into the corresponding Teams team chat history. We recommend that you enable Office 365 Group Creation and Microsoft Teams no later than June 30, 2019, and that you do not delete these teams or groups as they are required to successfully migrate data into Microsoft Teams.<BR>

We are simplifying the distinction between our PowerApps and Microsoft Flow for Office 365 plans and the standalone plans.<BR>
Starting February 1, 2019, the following capabilities will require a PowerApps or Microsoft Flow Plan 1 or Plan 2 license:
- Integration of on-premises data through the on-premises data gateway
- Custom connectors<BR>
- HTTP triggers and actions inside Microsoft Flow<BR>
[How does this affect me?]
After February 1, 2019 users will require a PowerApps or Flow Plan 1 or Plan 2 license to run PowerApps apps and Microsoft Flow using the capabilities listed above. Our records indicate that your organization has not used these capabilities recently.<BR>
<b>If you do plan to use these capabilities after February 1, 2019, you must request an extension</b> to be able to access them for an additional 12 months or until the end of your current eligible Office 365 subscription term, whichever is longer. (Note: Integration of on-premises data through the on-premises data gateway and Custom connectors are not included with Office 365 Business, Office 365 Enterprise E1 or Office 365 F1 licenses.)<BR>
You can find out who in your organization creates apps and flows by visiting the PowerApps and Microsoft Flow Admin centers.<BR>
[What do I need to do to prepare for this change?]
If your organization does not plan to use the capabilities listed above, no action is required.<BR>
If you plan to use the capabilities listed above, <b>submit a ticket to request an extension via Microsoft support before January 31, 2019</b> to ensure uninterrupted service. <b>Your ability to request an extension will expire on April 30, 2019.</b><BR>

Current status: We&#39;ve confirmed that 85 percent of the remaining backlogs, which contains message trace details from April 4 through April 7, 2019, has processed. Based on current progress, we anticipate that the backlogs will process and the issue will be resolved by Monday, April 15, 2019. While we monitor, we&#39;re continuing to evaluate whether any actions can be taken to expedite resolution.<BR>
Scope of impact: Any admin may be unable to view message trace details or access reports and logs within the SCC.<BR>
Estimated time to resolve: Based on current progress, we expect the issue to be fully resolved by Monday, April 15, 2019.<BR>

User Impact: Users are unable to edit workflows or create new workflows in SharePoint 2010 using Designer and other protocols.<BR>
More info: Users may receive the error: &quot;Unexpected error on server associating the workflow,&quot; and &quot;Errors were found when compiling the workflow. The Workflow files were saved but cannot run.&quot;<BR>
As a result of this problem, you may be unable to execute the following tasks:
- Activating features that contain out-of-the-box or custom 2010 workflows
- Provisioning out-of-the-box or custom site templates that contain 2010 workflows<BR>
Additionally, attempting to edit existing workflows may cause those workflows to become dissociated with their SharePoint list. We&#39;ve developed a fix for this issue and are preparing to apply it across the affected environment. Affected customers are encouraged to refrain from attempting to edit existing workflows until our fix is deployed.<BR>
Current status: We&#39;ve sufficiently tested the viability of the .net fix and have begun to prepare the fix for deployment. We estimate that this fix will be fully deployed by Saturday, March 23, 2019.<BR>
In an effort to implement some relief in the environment, we&#39;ve initiated the deployment of two supplementary changes:<BR>
1). The first change will allow out-of-the-box workflows without any customization to begin working as expected.
2). The second change will allow site collections with out-of-the-box workflows to provision as expected.<BR>
These supplementary fixes should complete their rollout by the middle to end of next week.<BR>
Scope of impact: Impact is specific to SharePoint 2010 workflows. Any user attempting to edit existing workflows or create new workflows may be affected by this event.<BR>
